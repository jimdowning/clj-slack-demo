# Writing a Chatbot with Clojure

* Ray Miller
* Jim Downing

---

## Objective

Create a Slack command integration to provide a quote of the day.

* We'll implement a web server to handle a Slack command integration.
  Our server will retrieve a quote of the day from a third-party REST
  API and post the resulting quote back to the Slack channel.

## Getting started at the REPL

Install Leiningen: http://leiningen.org/#install

```bash
lein repl
```

```clojure-repl
user=> (println "Hello World")
```

---
## Getting help

You can use functions from the `clojure.repl` namespace to get help in
the REPL:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.repl :refer [doc source find-doc]])
(doc assoc)
(source assoc)
```

I always have the Clojure Cheatsheet open in a browser tab:
http://jafingerhut.github.io/cheatsheet/clojuredocs/cheatsheet-tiptip-cdocs-summary.html


---
## Getting started with this workshop

We're going to build out an application from a skeleton we made earlier.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ray1729/clj-slack-demo.git
```

If you don't have git installed, you can download a zipfile from
https://github.com/ray1729/clj-slack-demo/archive/master.zip

## Clojure as a REST client

---
### Clojure as a REST client 1/5: Dependencies

We use the `clj-http` library, a sophisticated HTTP client, and the
`cheshire` library to parse and generate JSON strings. Check out
`project.clj` to see how these are configured.


```bash
cd clj-slack-demo
cat project.clj
```

When we start a REPL in the project directory, Leiningen will
automatically download the dependencies if we don't already have a
local copy.

```bash
lein repl
```

---
### Clojure as a REST client 2/5: Our first request

```clojure
(require '[clj-http.client :as http] '[clojure.pprint :refer [pprint]])
(def response (http/get "http://quotes.rest/qod.json"))
(pprint response)
```

---

### Clojure as a REST client 3/5: Parsing the body

```clojure
(def response (http/get "http://quotes.rest/qod.json" {:as :json}))
(pprint response)
(get-in response [:body :contents :quotes 0 :quote])
```

---
### Clojure as a REST client 4/5: Query parameters

```clojure
(def categories (http/get "http://quotes.rest/qod/categories.json" {:as :json}))
(get-in categories [:body :contents :categories])
(pprint (http/get "http://quotes.rest/qod.json"
                  {:as :json :query-params {:category "art"}}))
```

---
### Clojure as a REST client 5/5: Setting request headers

```clojure
(def api-key "h7GmOyL2jnVBjDgNyoaEDAeF")
(http/get "http://quotes.rest/qod.json"
          {:as :json
           :query-params {:category "life"}
           :headers {"X-Theysaidso-API-Secret" api-key}})
```

---
## Exercises

Open the file `src/chatbot/quotes.clj` in your favourite text editor.
There are three functions whose function body has been left for you to
fill in.

* Write a function `list-categories` to return the list of quote of
  the day categories.

* Write a function `get-qod` to return a quote of the day.

* Write a function `valid-qod-category?` that takes a string,
  `category`, and returns `true` if this is a recognized category,
  otherwise `false`.

* Modify your `get-qod` function to take an optional category. The
  function should verify that this is a valid category and retrieve a
  quote for that category.

### Extension exercises

* Calling `list-categories` every time we need to validate a category
  is an expensive operation - it requires a network request. Read
  about Clojure's `memoize` function and implement a memoized version
  of your `list-categories` function.

* The quote returned by the quote of the day API only changes once a
  day. Can you update your `get-qod` function to store
  the returned quote for a given category and refresh it only once a
  day?

## Posting messages to Slack

---
### Posting messages to Slack 1/2

Configure an incoming WebHook:

https://dev-summer-cb.slack.com/apps/manage/

Make a note of the WebHook URL:

```clojure
(def webhook-url "https://hooks.slack.com/services/...")
```

Post a message to Slack:

```clojure
(http/post webhook-url {:form-params {:text "My first message"}
                                      :content-type :json})
```

???

TODO Grab my changes from this morning.

---
### Posting messages to Slack 2/2: Advanced message formatting

https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments

```clojure
(def params
  {:attachments
    [{:fallback
      "New ticket from Andrea Lee - Ticket #1943: Can't rest my password - https://groove.hq/path/to/ticket/1943",
      :pretext "New ticket from Andrea Lee",
      :title "Ticket #1943: Can't reset my password",
      :title_link "https://groove.hq/path/to/ticket/1943",
      :text "Help! I tried to reset my password but nothing happened!",
      :color "#7CD197"}]})
(http/post webhook-url {:form-params params :content-type :json})
```

---
## Exercise

* Use your `get-qod` function to retrieve a quote of the day, and
  post the resultant quote to Slack. *Hint: adding the prefix `>>>` to
  your message text formats it as a multi-line quote.*


---
## Custom slack commands

---
### Slash commands

https://api.slack.com/slash-commands

Messages that start with a slash / are commands and will behave
differently from regular messages. For example, you can use the
"topic" command to change your current channel's topic to "Hello!" by
typing `/topic Hello!`. When you type `/remind me in 10 minutes to drink
a glass of water` the command will set a reminder for you to drink a
glass of water in 10 minutes.

---
### Custom commands

We implement a custom command by configuring Slack to POST the
command's payload to a remote URL. The remote server returns an
ephemeral message to the user or a posts a response to the channel.
The payload will look something like:

```
token=gIkuvaNzQIHg97ATvDxqgjtO
team_id=T0001
team_domain=example
channel_id=C2147483705
channel_name=test
user_id=U2147483697
user_name=Steve
command=/weather
text=94070
response_url=https://hooks.slack.com/commands/1234/5678
```

---
### Handling a custom command

To handle a Slack command, we should:

* Check the token to make sure it is a valid command
* Check the command to make sure it is recogvized by our handler
* Parse any arguments from the `text` field
* Generate a response to return to Slack

---
### Custom command example

A walk through the skeleton web application.

---
## Exercise

* Configure your own custom command in our Slack team - use a unique
  name for the command, e.g. by prefixing with your name.

* Extend the skeleton application to implement handler to process a
  Slack quote of the day command.

Testing section here?

We have a chicken-and-egg situation: we have to specify the web url
for the app, but can't do this before we've created the Heroku app.

---
## Deploying to Heroku

- Install Heroku Toolbelt
- Login and create app
- Configure leiningen integration
- Deploy and start app

---

### Heroku 1/5: Install Heroku Toolbelt

https://toolbelt.heroku.com/

---

### Heroku 2/5: Login and create app
```bash
$ heroku login
Enter your Heroku credentials.
Email: adam@example.com
Password (typing will be hidden):
Authentication successful.

$ cd ~/myapp
$ heroku create
Creating vast-citadel-38177... done, stack is cedar-14
http://vast-citadel-38177.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/vast-citadel-38177.git
Git remote heroku added
```

---

### Heroku 3/5: Configure leiningen integration

Most of this has already been done for you in project.clj

```clojure
:plugins [[lein-ring "0.9.7"]
          [lein-heroku "0.5.3"]]
* :heroku {:app-name "vast-citadel-38177"
         :jdk-version "1.8"
         :include-files ["target/chatbot-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar"]
         :process-types {"web" "java -jar target/chatbot-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar"}}
```

You just need to customize the app-name on the highlighted line.

???
TODO: Would be good to get this out of project.clj

---

### Deploy and start app

Deploy:
```bash
lein ring uberjar
lein heroku deploy-uberjar
```

Start:
```bash
heroku ps:scale web=1 -a vast-citadel-38177
```

After a few seconds, try to access the status handler:

https://vast-citadel-38177.herokuapp.com/status

## Putting the pieces together

Create Slack command integration, use URL for your Heroku slack
endpoint:
